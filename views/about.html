<div class="aboutMe" >
    <p>Iâ€™m Ethan Ebel and I am currently a full time web development student at General Assembly Chicago. I love the challenging and fast paced environment at GA. It is allowing me to do, and acquire skills I never thought I would be able to learn. Before attending I worked for an awning contractor, traveling around the Midwest installing large pergotenda, commercial and retractable awnings. Working for a general contractor has allowed me to challenge myself and my mindset. I was given projects I had never before faced. Then I went on to start a collectible coin business. This was probably the biggest challenge and has become one of my greatest rewards. Starting my own business has shown me how I can use my persistent mind set and hard work to build something I never though I would be capable of.</p>
